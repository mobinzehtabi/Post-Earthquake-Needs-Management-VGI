This project is a VGI (Volunteered Geographic Information) system for post-earthquake needs management.
It enables users to register their details, specify urgent needs (like water, food, or shelter), and stores this information in an SQLite database.

Key Components:
- VGI System Code(vgi2.py): Collects user data via a simple GUI, allowing easy submission of needs.
- SQLite Database(s_q_l.py): Stores user and needs data in tables for quick retrieval and efficient needs management.
This tool provides responders with organized access to critical information, helping them allocate resources more effectively.
